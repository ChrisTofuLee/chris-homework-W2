# Responsive Portfolio

Using Bootstrap only I have built a responsive site that will change the layout accordingly when switching between a mobile screen and a larger screen due to mobile first becoming more prominent.  

## Functionalities

The site will include the following:
- A responsive navbar - this should carry out across the whole site
- responsive images
- responsive layouts
- functioning links
- semantics
- Valid HTML
- Footer
